# Copper TODO

Track outstanding work and verification here. Completed implementation history lives in Git.

## Public repository and releases

The published baseline is [Copper 0.1.0](https://github.com/antick/copper/releases/tag/v0.1.0),
which used ad-hoc macOS signing and manual updates. Version 0.2.2 adds Developer ID signed,
Apple-notarized macOS installers and in-app updates, while Windows/Linux keep manual updates.
Copper Dev has independent identity and app data; explicitly shared Vault folders are still shared.

- [x] Configure main protection, restricted release tags, and a reviewed tag-only `release` environment.
- [x] Install verified existing Apple signing and notarization credentials as environment-scoped secrets.
- [x] Implement isolated Copper Dev identity, icon, profile, and disabled automatic updates.
- [x] Implement update progress, explicit restart, save-before-restart, and retry behavior.
- [x] Finish local integrated verification and record the results below; CI/public gates remain below.
- [x] Verify a real signed/notarized installer and signed-version-to-signed-version update on macOS.
- [ ] Publish the Apple Silicon-only macOS and Windows/Linux 0.2.2 installer set and verify public downloads, updater metadata, and website.
- [ ] Complete Windows/Linux interactive acceptance; native packaging checks are not a complete UI test.
- [ ] Retire the legacy release repository separately; its private backup exists, but deletion was previously blocked by token permissions. Legacy clients need a manual installation from this repository.

Release checks currently retain two reviewed build-tool audit exceptions (`braces` and `sprintf-js`)
in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; a successful audit with those exceptions is not a zero-advisory result.
Do not mark release work complete on source tests alone. Keep published tags and artifacts immutable.
Local verification and the remaining public-release gates are recorded in
[the 0.2.0 verification record](docs/release/verification-0.2.0.md).

## Landing page and monorepo

The desktop app lives in `apps/desktop`; `apps/landing` is the Astro, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui landing site. Root scripts coordinate both apps with Turborepo.

Verified: 246 frontend tests, 128 native tests, the landing production-output test, both type checks, Biome, both production builds, and the desktop browser build. The landing page was checked at 320, 390, and 1280 pixels, including keyboard FAQ controls. A local unpacked macOS build loaded SQLite and retained its entry points and icons. The exact Vercel install/build commands passed in a disposable copy without desktop dependencies. Signed desktop distribution remains pending.

The landing page is live at [copper.potion.sh](https://copper.potion.sh) on Vercel. Cloudflare’s DNS-only CNAME is configured, and HTTPS, page content, the canonical URL, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and the 404 response have been verified.

Notes and Tasks are now both represented in the landing hero, navigation, dedicated Tasks section, social metadata, README, welcome copy, and demo note. Four refreshed screenshots cover Notes, the Tasks list, the project board, and Appearance. Screenshot preparation uses only demo preview data. Verified: 246 frontend tests, 128 native tests, two landing checks (production output with all four images, plus safe and repeatable demo preparation), both type checks, Biome, both production builds, screenshot helper syntax, and the real capture steps through the shared browser. The production page loads every image and fits 320, 390, and 1440 pixel widths. The standalone screenshot CLI wrapper was syntax-checked; browser steps were executed through T3. The Tasks presentation is published; the landing download link and platform/installation copy now target the first installer release.


## Native acceptance

- [ ] Complete interactive installation and primary UI flows on Windows and Linux; native CI packaging and SQLite checks passed.

- [ ] Complete attachment-import confirmation, external-link handoff, clipboard, and native development startup/hot-reload checks after the security changes. Packaged opening/editing, Git denial/grant/diff review, and remote-image consent have been verified.
- [ ] Confirm right-edge painting after manual macOS resizing and moving between displays.
- [ ] Confirm physical window dragging with ordinary native input.
- [ ] Verify the installed app's icon in Finder, Dock, Stage Manager, and Mission Control after replacing any stale installed copy.

## Advanced task workflows

- [ ] Add the index schema/data for task links and checkboxes in ordinary notes.
- [ ] Add parent/dependency links with cycle rejection, milestones, and shared Properties/backlink controls.
- [ ] Add explicit saved views in `Tasks/views.md`; changing a filter must not silently overwrite a saved view.
- [ ] Add a note-task inbox, exact-line checkbox toggling, and conversion to an issue. Keep note tasks out of board cards.
- [ ] Verify the complete flows, accessibility, persistence, and documentation before shipping.

## Follow-up improvements

- [ ] Split optional editor language data to reduce large production chunks.
- [ ] Verify and fix accessible names for rendered editor task checkboxes and editable Properties values in the full narrow workspace.

## Future ideas

- [ ] GitHub onboarding for non-Git vaults: sign in, create/link a private repository, and clone from Welcome.
- [ ] Optional idle/on-quit vault backup after the manual commit/push flow is proven.
- [ ] User-created color themes with editing, import/export, validation, preview, and recovery.
- [ ] A plugin system with explicit capabilities, isolation, compatibility, crash recovery, and safe mode.
- [ ] Opt-in custom CSS with documented selectors, live reload, validation, and reliable recovery to the stock UI.
- [ ] Excalidraw canvases as a separate feature, preserving the existing Tasks data model.
